/**
 * Warms Coil's disk cache for every poster in [posterUrls] so the grid doesn't
 * fetch over the network as cards scroll into view. Posters nearest the current
 * scroll anchor are warmed first, in [WAVE]-sized waves; between waves the
 * scroll anchor is re-read, so flinging re-prioritises the still-unwarmed
 * posters around the new position. Every poster is warmed eventually, even
 * while the list sits idle.
 *
 * [posterUrls] must mirror the grid's item order 1:1 — pass a blank string for
 * any non-poster grid item (e.g. a section header) so a list index lines up
 * with [LazyGridState.firstVisibleItemIndex] and the nearest-first ordering is
 * exact.
 *
 * Disk-only (memory cache disabled): prefetch lands the bytes on disk and the
 * on-screen `SubcomposeAsyncImage` decodes from there on first paint — no
 * network wait — without pinning hundreds of decoded bitmaps in memory. Coil's
 * default disk cache is a bounded LRU, so warming can't grow the cache without
 * bound.
